# Wordle_Project:

This project was created for an optional extra-credit question for a speech recognition class. The project is a paradoy of Wordle, but utilizing the python arcade package.
This project is a precursor to another [speech recognition project](https://github.com/littlebluewizard/CS-582-Semester-Project), where we utilized a speech model, to recognize voice commands alongside two players to play the classic game pong.
